# 🩵 Data Analysis Libraries for AI & ML

Welcome to the **Data Analysis Libraries for AI & ML** repository — a complete hands-on learning and project series designed to master the **core Python data stack** every AI/ML engineer needs.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This repository is part of my **90-Day AI/ML Learning Journey (Phase 2)**.  
It focuses on mastering Python’s essential data manipulation and visualization libraries through **practical notebooks, datasets, and mini-projects**.

Whether you're preparing for AI, ML, or GenAI projects — these libraries form your *data foundation.*

## 🧩 Integration Project

**AI/ML Data Toolkit Notebook** — combines all libraries in one pipeline:
1. Load data (Pandas)
2. Clean & preprocess (NumPy + Pandas)
3. Visualize patterns (Matplotlib + Seaborn)
4. Build and evaluate model (Scikit-learn)

This notebook represents your **Phase 2 capstone** project.

## 🪴 Learning Philosophy

> "Don’t just learn methods — build things that prove your understanding."

Each folder in this repo is designed to:
- Teach you practical library usage  
- Reinforce it with small hands-on projects  
- Help you publish your learning on **Kaggle**, **Medium**, and **LinkedIn**
